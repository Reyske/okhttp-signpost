okhttp-signpost
========

A [Signpost][1] extension for signing [OkHttp][2] requests.

Download
=======
Gradle:
```gradle
    compile 'se.akerfeldt:okhttp-signpost:1.0.0'
    compile 'okhttp3:okhttp:2.5.0'
    compile 'oauth.signpost:signpost-core:1.2.1.2'
```
Usage
=======

To use, simply create an instance of `OkHttpOAuthConsumer` passing in your consumer key/secret pair.
Set your token and token secret. Lastly, create a SigningInterceptor with your consumer and give it to your
`OkHttpClient.Builder`.

```java
OkHttpOAuthConsumer consumer = new OkHttpOAuthConsumer(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET);
consumer.setTokenWithSecret(token, secret);

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(new SigningInterceptor(consumer))
        .build();
```

The `SigningInterceptor` is a convenience for signing the request but is not mandatory. You could also sign your request
manually like so:

```java
OkHttpOAuthConsumer consumer = ...
Request request = new Request.Builder().build();
Request signedRequest = (Request) consumer.sign(request).unwrap();

Call call = okHttpClient.newCall(signedRequest);
```

Obviously, this fits very well with [Retrofit 2][3] as well. Just pass your OkHttpClient (containing the interceptor) to
Retrofit:
```java
OkHttpOAuthConsumer consumer = new OkHttpOAuthConsumer(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET);
consumer.setTokenWithSecret(token, secret);

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(new SigningInterceptor(consumer))
        .build();

return new Retrofit.Builder()
        ...
        .client(okHttpClient)
        .build();

```
